# japanese drew machines.

A _dub dub dub_ (www) website for my homie, Drew.  
This has been about 3 years in the making. Lot's of work was completed, yessirrey.  
I am now releasing into the wild.
  
## Yo! Other devs...  
I know js frameworks are your thing, but hear me out... You will never deploy a cool site like this.  
So, watch where this goes and note the following.

```
This is an initial release for a simple POC  
Be warned, access to this server is limited to only the authorized awesome. Those who are named  Drew.
```

**Also, also,** This site will full functionality is **TBD**.  

## To install  

Installation could be done by your mother.  
It's like this... starting from your favorite command prompt with bit installed.  
`git clone [this repo]`.
